Sponsor Nette Development
*************************

We develop Nette Framework for {AGE} years. In order to make your life more comfortable.
Can you even imagine life without Tracy or Latte? Nette cares about the safety of your sites.
Nette saves you time. And gives job opportunities.

Nette earns you money. And is absolutely free.

To ensure future development and improving the documentation, **we need financial support from you.** You can support us via the following methods:


One-time Donations

Recurring Pledges .[#partner]
-----------------------------

If you run a business and are using Nette in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Nette development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your exposure in the Nette community and makes it easier to attract Nette developers.

The partnership comes with exclusive benefits, such as listing your business logo on this site, the ability to advertise on a forum or in the documentation.

If you are interested in partnership, please email me at david@grudl.com.
